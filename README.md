This is a repository of the scratch work that's arisen while reading [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks](http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Databases-Weeks-Modern-Movement-ebook/dp/B00AYQNR50/). 

Each chapter has its own folder, and each folder contains the Vagrant config that I used to work through that chapter. Commits of the databases' state are also present.
